## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before we began creating models

## Data Pre Processing

In its original state, the data is mostly unusable; There are a lot of columns that contain information that are not relevant, and rows that are outside the scope of our assignment.

### Cleaning

## Filtering

As previously mentioned, there are rows that we discovered that would not have any impact on our study. In some cases, the Yelp reviews are not about a restaurant in the Las Vegas metropolitan area, and in other cases, the Yelp reviews are not about a restaurant at all.

In order to make sure we selected only the data that mattered to us we used the following lines of code:

`this is a line of code`
